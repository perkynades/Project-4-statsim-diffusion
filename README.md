# Project-4-statsim-diffusion

## Overview of the project

In this project the goal is to studiy diffusion in two dimentions, The project will contain: 

1. A probability distrubution for how a particle moves in one time step.
2. A visualisation of the consentration of particles over time steps.
3. A probability distrubution for where each particle is placed after "*t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5*" timesteps.
4. A reflection with:  
a. An explenation on why i have simulated and why. Hvor many particles must the simulation start with to get good results. \
b. Compare the analytical results with the simulation. \
c. Consider what you have learned and what you can take with you as a computer scientis.
